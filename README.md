<h1 align="center">Steam Deck Emulation Guide</h1>

This guide covers how to install emulators on a Steam Deck, setting up controls, playing games with optimal settings, and integrating them into Steam itself.

**This is an unofficial guide, not affiliated with Valve**. To the best of my knowledge, it's not possible to mess up your Deck from this guide, but I'm not responsible if you do.

## Getting Started

This guide assumes your ROMs are under `~/roms` (a folder in your home directory), with a file structure like this:

```
roms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ switch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wiiu
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wii
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gamecube
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n64
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nes
```

If you store your roms on an SD card, substitute `~/roms` with `/run/media/Deck/roms` in the guide.

This guide **does not** cover getting the games themselves.

We're going to use [Steam ROM Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/) for this guide. It will automatically download cover art for each ROM, then add a shortcut to Steam for the game. The end result will look like this, with Steam collections for each system:

Switch to Desktop mode by pressing the **Steam** button, navigating to **Power**, then **Switch to Desktop**.

Go to Steam ROM Manager's [latest release](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager/releases/latest), then download the file ending in `.AppImage` that **DOES NOT** contain `i386`. It should be named something like `Steam-ROM-Manager-2.3.29.AppImage`.

Open SteamOS' file manager Dolphin (it's different from the emulator Dolphin), then navigate to wherever you saved the file, probably in **Downloads**. You can run it by just double-tapping the file.

From here, the guide branches off for each system you want to emulate:

-   [Nintendo Switch](./emulators/yuzu.md)
-   [GameCube and/or Wii](./emulators/dolphin.md)
-   [Nintendo 64](./emulators/m64p.md)
